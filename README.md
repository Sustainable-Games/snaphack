# Snap!Hack
An implementation of the roguelike Hack in Snap!

Snap!Hack is an implementation of the Hack roguelike game created primarily by Jay Fenlason when he was a student of Brian Harvey's at Lincoln-Sudbury High School. The game is implemented in the Snap! programming language, which was co-created by Brian Harvey and Jens M&ouml;nig, as an homage to Brian Harvey's impact on computer science education.
